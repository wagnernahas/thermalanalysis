# thermalanalysis
The formulation applied here is based in modelling of heat transfer from sill to the host rocks related to a simple 1D of porous media energy equation for thermal analysis. The porous media has a solid domain, rock, and a pore structure (voids) which are fluid filled, in this system a the energy equation[[1]](#1) can be defined as: 
$$\mathrm{\frac{\partial ((\phi\rho_f c_f+(1-\phi)\rho_m c_m)T)}{\partial t} =\nabla.((\phi K_f+(1-\phi) K_m)\nabla T)+H_L+H_D+A}$$
where T is the temperature, $\rho_m$ is the rock density, $\rho_f$ is the fluid density, $c_m$ is the specific heat capacity of rock, $c_f$ is the specific heat capacity of fluid, $K_m$ is the thermal diffusivity of rock, $K_f$ is the thermal diffusivity of fluid and $\phi$ is the porosity. The terms H
